        <h1>My favourite movies</h1>
        <p>Film is a great passion of mine, I've spent 100s of hours in the world of movies and film making. Here i shall list some movies which have moulded my current mindset and passion for this medium.</p>
        
        
        <h2>1. Fightclub</h2>
        <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><p>This movie was directed by David Fincher. However this was not the first movie which I had seen by Fincher. My first dip into the world on Fincher was a movie titled Panic Room starring Jodie Foster. While a incredibly gripping movie filled with the stylish cinematography Fincher is resounded for, Panic Room was not the movie which started my love for film.</p>
            
            <p>Fight club is a movie filled with themes of consumerism, identity, duality of man, addiction and mental health. The opening scene features the protagonist taking part in AA meetings despite having no addictions himself. This is the exact moment where I realised that fight club was different from the dozens of movies I had seen previously.
